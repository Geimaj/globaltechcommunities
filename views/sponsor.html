        <h3>Sponsor:</h3>

        <p>So, your brand like to get involved with the tech community? Tech initiatives are always looking for sponsors to help take their ideas to the next level, and give their solutions a broader impact. If you believe that your brand is ready to help make this a reality, or if you’d just like access to a group of interested, invested tech people, you’ve come to the right place. Take a look at our past events and photo galleries to see how past sponsors have aligned their brands when sponsoring one of our tech groups.</p>
